Check list before running a script:
    1 - 'rm -r /home/gav061/.cache/wandb/'
    2 - Remove comment on import wandb in Trainers.py
    3 - Add comment to the pipeline debugger lines
    4 - Check WandB website if everything is well setup
    5 - Delete folder logs
    6 - Clear folder results
    7 - Not all runs at the same time - otherwise wandb would be overloaded
